# 📈 Stock Market Forecasting using LSTM, ARIMA, SARIMA & Prophet

This project predicts stock market trends using various forecasting models, including:

- 🧠 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – Deep Learning
- 📊 ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- 📈 SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- 🔮 Prophet – Forecasting tool by Meta

The models are applied to real-world stock data (`apple_data.csv`) for Apple Inc.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-forecasting.git
cd stock-market-forecasting
````

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 👉 Run the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Stock_market_forecasting.ipynb
```

This walks through:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Training each model (LSTM, ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet)
* Evaluation metrics and visualizations

### 👉 OR launch the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This gives you an interactive UI to visualize forecasts from each model.

| Model   | Seasonality | Trend | Handles Noise | Training Time          |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| ARIMA   | ❌           | ✅     | ❌             | ⏱️ Fast                |
| SARIMA  | ✅           | ✅     | ❌             | ⏱️ Fast                |
| Prophet | ✅           | ✅     | ✅ (basic)     | ⏱️ Medium              |
| LSTM    | ✅           | ✅     | ✅ (deep)      | 🐢 Slow (needs tuning) |
